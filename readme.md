# Visit me in Colorado

Hey, friends! remember when I said you should come visit me in CO and you thought - "Damn that sounds fun, but I bet he will never follow up & I will never get to shred some of that sweet, sweet pow"

Well guess what, you're in luck, I did follow up (at least with most of you I think)!

Yep I really want you to come visit so grab your shred-mobile, put a time on my calendar, eat a power bar, stay healthy, swig some water, huck a quick sick 180 from normal life and fly out.

Below I have included a collection of travel logistics that I will continue to update as I learn more about this wholesome adventure. So stay tuned and the rest is up to you. :)

Denver seems to be the more popular option on google flights

The [Ikon Passes](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes) seem to be some of the best value packages to get on the mountain this year
  - [4 day](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes/ikon-session-pass-4-day-2020-2021) would probably make sense for an aggressive long weekend or a chill week
  - As a side note it doesn't seem, as of now, that the mountain will be offering single day passes
