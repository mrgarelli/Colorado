# Ikon Pass
### [December 10 deadline for Ikon Purchases!](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIV8XZjAMqg/?igshid=g62hoz8d22wv)

* The [Ikon Passes](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes) seem to be some of the best value packages to get on the mountain this year
	- [4 day](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes/ikon-session-pass-4-day-2020-2021) would probably make sense for an aggressive long weekend or a chill week
* Day passes will NOT be sold on the mountain this year (so you need to get Ikon if you want to shred pow)

Grab your shred-mobile, put a time on my calendar, eat a power bar, stay healthy, swig some water, huck a quick sick 180 from normal life and fly out.

Below I have included a collection of travel logistics that I will continue to update as I learn more about this wholesome adventure. So stay tuned and the rest is up to you. :)
